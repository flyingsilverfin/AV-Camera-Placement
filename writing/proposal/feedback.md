Proposal

* how to present assumption
* how to tackle it

have path to travel = because we have a map, we can plan an optimal path
not necessary to say using 1 robot

Only relaly start with startig position and where in map the starting position

Know Noise model for dead reckoning: accuracy loss/meter
Know sensor noise models

show how bad dead reckoning is on its own as a comparison
other end of spectrum: no dead reckoning, only use sensor information. Smooth out values from sensor

new analysis: what would it cost us in terms of accuracy to reduce sensors
very new: analyze effect of environment shape

work plan: start with just dead reckoning, with true full information, then add noise until can't navigate course
work plan 2: other end of spectrum - add sensors, no dead reckoning


metrics: speed, success rate, 

at some point keep 1 or two interesting race courses (zigzag vs O)

second extension: mathematical analysis
