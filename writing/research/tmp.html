<ul>
<li>These placement algorithms are based on a single vehicle's dynamics
<ul>
<li>They also use holonomic vehicles when demonstrating?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose a sensor model
<ul>
<li>Active (measures car =&gt; communicates) vs Passive (landmark =&gt; car reads and knows its position from an internal map)</li>
<li>How is the idea that the faster you drive by a sensor, the less certain the information you get incorporated
<ul>
<li>i.e. greater uncertainty reduction the slower you go up to some minimum noise level</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Focus on speed</li>
<li>Existing work seems to use a fixed speed? Can't quite tell (TODO)</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible end goal: * Develop a * speed around track, confidence around track ~ f(sensor noise, car model, sensor positions, track)</p>
