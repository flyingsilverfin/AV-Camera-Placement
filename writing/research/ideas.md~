## ideas
* These placement algorithms are based on a single vehicle's dynamics
  * They also use holonomic vehicles when demonstrating?
Use simplest non-holonomic system = ackerman or differential

* Choose a sensor model
  * Active (measures car => communicates) vs Passive (landmark => car reads and knows its position from an internal map)
  * How is the idea that the faster you drive by a sensor, the less certain the information you get incorporated
    * i.e. greater uncertainty reduction the slower you go up to some minimum noise level


* Focus on speed
  * Existing work seems to use a fixed speed? Can't quite tell (TODO)
	

Possible end goal:
* Develop a function that determines confidence of completing track a certain speed (or within a certain time?)
  * How to make this work as speed varies around the track?
* speed profile around track, confidence around track ~ f(sensor noise, car model, sensor positions, track)
  * Quantify effectiveness of a certain road type - we might be able to use this as a road planning tool for cities of the future!
	Ie. it might be safest/fastest to connect nodes in a city via two right turns and straight segments OR 
  * No slip 
* Dual: generate sensor positions ~ f(sensor noise, car model(s), speed models, track)
